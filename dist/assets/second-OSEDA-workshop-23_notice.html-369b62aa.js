To achieve this common goal, active contributors from the RISC-V open-source community and the EDA research field established the OSEDA community, dedicated to developing and promoting open-source EDA technologies and tools in the RISC-V community. The short-term goal of the OSEDA community is to attract over 1,000 developers and over 10,000 developers by 2025 to join the open-source EDA community and contribute to open-source projects.</p>","copyright":{"author":"iEDA","license":"GPL-3.0"}}');export{e as data};
