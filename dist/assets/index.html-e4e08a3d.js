Practice Objectives</strong></h2>\\n<p>In order to provide a teaching practice platform for EDA courses or training, and taking into account students' abilities and practical applications, this course intends to decompose EDA-related practical tasks into multiple subtasks. This can balance the difficulty and achievability of the practical course, allowing students to gradually improve their skills and complete tasks within the course instead of facing a highly difficult overall project at the beginning. For example, students can be familiarized with basic algorithms and data flows first, and then the use of EDA tools and design methods can be gradually introduced.</p>","copyright":{"author":"iEDA","license":"GPL-3.0"}}`);export{e as data};
