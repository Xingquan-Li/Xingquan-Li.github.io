This platform will support the exploration of new EDA research methodologies and technologies, train EDA professionals, and facilitate the synchronization of knowledge transfer between industry and academia. This will create a good product-research-development loop, improve the efficiency and quality of EDA research, and invite EDA experts to discuss open-source and intelligent EDA tools and algorithm technologies.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><strong>Chairperson:</strong> <strong>Li Huawei</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Institute of Computational Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences</strong></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><strong>Co-Chairperson:</strong>  <strong>Li Xingquan</strong></td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>","copyright":{"author":"iEDA","license":"GPL-3.0"}}');export{e as data};
