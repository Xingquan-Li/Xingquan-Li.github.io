The pseudo-transient analysis method has been proven to be one of the most promising SPICE simulation solution methods. However, the computational efficiency of this method is greatly limited by the inserted pseudo-device parameters and the simulation time step control. This report will introduce a Bayesian optimization and deep reinforcement learning accelerated pseudo-transient analysis method, which can significantly accelerate the simulation and improve the convergence performance without introducing additional errors. This method is equipped with advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning, Gaussian process, Bayesian optimization, non-stationary monotonic transformation, variational inference through reparameterization, deep reinforcement learning, common sample pool, and priority sampling. In addition, this report will also introduce a random forest based circuit matrix sparse LU decomposition acceleration technology, which can effectively accelerate the circuit matrix solution speed through the optimization of the density-aware adaptive matrix multiplication algorithm.</p><p><strong>Speaker Profile</strong></p><p>Jin Zhou, an associate professor at China University of Petroleum (Beijing), was selected into the Beijing Association for Science and Technology Youth Talent Support Project and the school&#39;s young top talent.

In addition, artificial intelligence technology (AI) has shown great application potential in various industries. In the direction of IC and EDA, many excellent works have also shown the possibility of AI + EDA. AI can efficiently process and analyze design data, provide predictions and optimization suggestions, thereby improving design efficiency and quality. However, at present, the interaction between AI models and EDA tools is still in the initial stage. In order to give full play to the effectiveness of AI in EDA, it is very necessary to design an AI + EDA basic framework, which is helpful to quickly explore effective methods of AI-assisted chip design and feed back to the tools, and at the same time allow more people to participate in the technological breakthrough of AI + EDA.</p><p><strong>Speaker Profile</strong></p><p>Huang Zhipeng is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Peng Cheng Laboratory.

To evaluate the potential of large language models to assist the hardware design process, this study attempts to present an automated design environment that uses large language models to generate hardware logic designs from natural language specifications. To achieve a more accessible and efficient chip development process, we propose a scalable four-stage design based on large language models without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. First, prompts are generated for the large language model, which then generates the initial Verilog program. Second, the output manager corrects and optimizes these programs and then collects them into the final design space. Finally, the output manager will search this space and select the best design that meets the target metrics. Our experiments reveal whether large language models can generate correct and complete hardware logic designs for certain design specifications. The results show that this method improves programmability and controllability compared to previous works and individual large language models, and shows a wider design optimization space.</p><p><strong>Speaker Profile</strong></p><p>Chang Kaiyan, graduated from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China with a bachelor&#39;s degree and is currently pursuing a doctoral degree at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of Associate Researcher Wang Ying and Researcher Li Huawei.

However, the lack of large public datasets in practice limits the scope of related researches and raises a high bar for new researchers. Therefore, in this talk, we propose an open-source dataset, CircuitNet, for MLCAD applications. CircuitNet contains over 20K samples from various open-source CPU, GPU, and AI accelerator designs with commercial 28nm &amp; 14nm PDKs. The dataset supports various tasks like timing, power, congestion, and IR-drop prediction. We also extract various features to support both image-based learning (e.g., ANN and CNN) and graph learning (e.g., GNN). We believe this dataset can open up new opportunities for machine learning in CAD research and beyond.</p><p><strong>Speaker Profile</strong></p><p>Xun Jiang (Jiang Xun) is currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Integrated Circuit Engineering at Peking University, Beijing, China.

It aims to extend the classic and mature development methodology of the software world - MLIR/LLVM Project to the field of hardware design tools, providing a reusable, scalable, and efficient compiler infrastructure for EDA tools for designing hardware (including but not limited to computer chips). Zhaosong has developed the ZVC compiler (ZhaoSong Verilog Compiler) on the CIRCT framework - a high-performance hardware compiler that supports multithreading. Focusing on the simulation design based on Cycle Based, it attempts to complete the entire process from translating the Core IR (core intermediate representation) of CIRCT to LLVM IR (LLVM intermediate representation). The focus of this report will be on the core design idea surrounding ZVC, the compilation process design on the CIRCT framework, and introduce how to build a hardware compiler using the CIRCT framework through algorithms and examples. By analyzing the No-more-inline design principle, it describes the design details of generating various corresponding logics around the preservation and transfer requirements of the circuit state; the multithreading part will explain and analyze the MLIR algorithm of LLVM IR used for node splitting on the graph; during this period, some of the latest upstream progress and subsequent exciting plans will be interspersed, sharing some new progress of Zhaosong in promoting CIRCT to support the compilation of SystemVerilog and the integration with Slang.</p><p><strong>Speaker Profile</strong></p><p>Xu Buyun graduated from Taiyuan University of Technology with a major in Information Security in 2021 and joined Zhaosong Technology (Wuhan) Co., Ltd. in 2022.

In this work, by simultaneously splitting both coefficient matrices in the differential and non-differential parts of the GAVE, a modified Newton-based matrix splitting (MNMS) iteration method is proposed. The MNMS iteration method not only covers the well-known generalized Newton iteration method as well as the recent proposed modified Newton-based iteration method and the Newton-based matrix splitting iteration method for solving the GAVE, but also results in a series of relaxation versions that are very flexible in real applications. Convergence properties of the MNMS iteration method are studied in detail when the coefficient matrices are general matrices, positive definite matrices and H+-matrices. Finally, three numerical examples are presented to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed MNMS iteration method.</p><p><strong>Speaker Profile</strong></p><p>Chencan Zhou, graduated from Dalian Maritime University with a master&#39;s degree.
