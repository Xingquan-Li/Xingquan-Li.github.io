There is an urgent need for an EDA learning course that enables quick entry. This project aims to create a general training program for comprehensive EDA talents, suitable for the technical stack training of iEDA team interns and the practical courses of EDA in colleges and universities. The aim is to lower the learning threshold of EDA and provide an EDA learning solution that is easy to get started with. After completing this project, learners will be able to understand the basic process of EDA development, initially master the knowledge of C++ and Rust programming languages, be familiar with the basic principles and processes of EDA tool development, understand the application of AI in EDA, and have the initial practical ability to develop basic-level EDA tool software and optimize EDA tools using AI technology.</p>","copyright":{"author":"iEDA","license":"GPL-3.0"}}');export{e as data};
