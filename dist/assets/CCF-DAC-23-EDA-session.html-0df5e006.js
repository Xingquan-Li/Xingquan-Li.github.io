This will form a good product-research-development loop, improving the efficiency and quality of EDA research. Open-source is the best way to provide EDA development platforms to all researchers in various disciplines, and this forum aims to promote the development of a high-quality open-source EDA tool platform and key technologies.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><strong>Chair</strong>: <strong>Bao Yungang</strong>, <strong>Institute of Computational Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences</strong></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><strong>Co-Chair</strong>: <strong>Li Xingquan</strong>, <strong>Pengcheng Laboratory</strong></td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>","copyright":{"author":"iEDA","license":"GPL-3.0"}}');export{e as data};
