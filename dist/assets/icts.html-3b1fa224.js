Overview</h2>\\n<p>Currently, iCTS supports clock tree construction under given constraints. Currently, iCTS takes DME and Slew-Aware as the basic framework and integrates multiple types of constraints for clock tree design. Due to the inability to obtain upstream Slew information in the bottom-up process of DME,<br>\\nThe downstream chained propagation will bring a large error. iCTS introduces the timing backward propagation method and performs timing propagation at the wire level during the buffer insertion stage to correct the insertion delay of the wire load unit.<br>\\niCTS uses a more accurate timing model for the estimation and propagation of timing information and constructs the clock tree with the goal of minimizing the design cost.</p>","copyright":{"author":"iEDA","license":"GPL-3.0"}}');export{e as data};
