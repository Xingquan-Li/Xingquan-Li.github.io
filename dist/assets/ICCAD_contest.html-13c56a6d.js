Competition Background</h3><p>Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools refer to a set of computer-aided design software for the entire automated chip design process, including functional design, logic synthesis, physical design, simulation verification, etc. As one of the strategic basic pillars of the integrated circuit industry chain, EDA actively promotes technological innovation in the chip industry and greatly improves the efficiency of the semiconductor industry.</p><p>The International Conference On Computer Aided Design (ICCAD) began in the 1980s and is one of the top academic conferences in the field of electronic design automation. The CAD Contest@ICCAD algorithm competition is the most influential international academic competition in the EDA field. The competition questions all come from the real business scenarios of globally renowned EDA/IC companies such as Synopsys, Cadence, Siemens EDA, Nvidia, IBM, and Dharma Academy, expecting to develop better solutions for the actual problems that the current industry urgently needs to solve. The results of the competition can be directly transformed into industrial solutions, which greatly promote the development of the field of computer-aided design of integrated circuits and attract high attention from both industry and academia every year.</p><p>A total of 166 teams from renowned universities and research institutions at home and abroad participated in this year&#39;s CAD Contest@ICCAD algorithm competition, such as the University of Tokyo, National Taiwan University, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Peking University, National Tsing Hua University of Taiwan, The University of Texas at Austin, Fudan University, etc.</p><h3 id="_2-interpretation-of-the-competition-question" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-interpretation-of-the-competition-question" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2. Interpretation of the Competition Question</h3><p>This year&#39;s CAD Contest@ICCAD algorithm competition released three questions. Since all the members of the research group have been involved in physical design-related research, we finally chose the 3D Die-to-Die Placement problem, which has a more fitting research background. Die-to-Die technology is one of the most widely used Chiplet technologies at present and is a key technology to break through 3D chip design in the future, which can bring higher yield, better timing, lower cost, etc. And placement is an extremely important part of physical design. The quality of the placement of unit positions directly affects the PPA (Performance, Power, Area) of the chip to a large extent. The competition question requires the participating teams to divide the netlist into two parts and determine the specific position of each unit in its respective layer on the basis of considering many complex constraints such as different processes in the upper and lower layers, layer utilization, the number and spacing constraints of hybrid bonding terminals, so as to minimize the total length of the routing. Solving this problem has a key improvement for enhancing the design quality of 3D chips.</p><h3 id="_3-competition-process" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-competition-process" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3. Competition Process</h3><p>3D Die-to-Die placement was brand new for our research group, which made us very interested in exploring the automated placement solution in this new scenario. We started working on the competition question at the end of June and submitted the code by early September, which took more than two months. Due to the late start and the desire to achieve a good result, it meant that we had to race against time, make a good time plan and division of labor and collaboration.</p>',8),v=e("img",{src:r,alt:"6",style:{zoom:"30%"},title:"Competition Timeline"},null,-1),C=e("p",null,'During the competition, we constantly had new ideas and quickly implemented them, always being passionate about solving the competition questions and optimizing the algorithm. On many late nights, we were still communicating the trial and error results and new ideas in the group chat. To alert and motivate each group member, we also made a score record sheet to compare with the then first place and constantly refreshed our best record. A tense插曲 occurred that a few days before the final version submission, the server environment image of ours was mistakenly deleted, which meant that our results could not be uploaded to the server of the organizer and further led to the scores being invalid. After discovering the problem, we immediately投入 into the repair of the server. Fortunately, there was no danger in the end. Two days before the submission, our apartment was controlled due to the epidemic. In this environment, we did not slack off and continued to jointly carry out the final performance improvement and process inspection. Our ability to stand out among many excellent participating teams is inseparable from the support of the research group and the joint efforts of each of our team members.
