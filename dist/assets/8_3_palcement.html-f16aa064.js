The process of completing a VLSI design is highly complex and involves the transformation of various data formats. The process of transforming the logical netlist into a manufacturable geometric layout is called physical design. The physical design process can be divided into floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, etc. Among them, placement is particularly crucial as it determines the positions of circuit cells and subsequently affects the subsequent stages.</p>","copyright":{"author":"iEDA","license":"GPL-3.0"}}');export{e as data};
