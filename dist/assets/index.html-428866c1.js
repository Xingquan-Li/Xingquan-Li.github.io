There is an urgent need for an EDA learning course that enables quick entry. This project aims to create a general training program for comprehensive EDA talents, suitable for the technical stack training of iEDA team interns and the practical courses of EDA in colleges and universities. The aim is to lower the learning threshold of EDA and provide an EDA learning solution that is easy to get started with. After completing this project, learners will be able to understand the basic process of EDA development, initially master the knowledge of C++ and Rust programming languages, be familiar with the basic principles and processes of EDA tool development, understand the application of AI in EDA, and have the initial practical ability to develop basic-level EDA tool software and optimize EDA tools using AI technology.</p><h2 id="trained-talents-in-the-project" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#trained-talents-in-the-project" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <strong>Trained Talents in the Project</strong></h2><div class="hint-container info"><p class="hint-container-title">Info</p><p><strong>4 in the first phase, 9 in the second phase, 13 in the third phase, 12 in the fourth phase, and 50 in the fifth phase.</strong></p><details class="hint-container details"><summary>Specific List Details</summary><ul><li><strong>First Phase (2020):</strong><ul><li>Ni Liwei (Peng Cheng Laboratory),</li><li>Zhuang Chunan (Peng Cheng Laboratory),</li><li>Long Shuaiying (Peng Cheng Laboratory),</li><li>Sun Jinghe (Shenyang Aerospace University),</li></ul></li><li><strong>Second Phase (2021):</strong><ul><li>Wu Shengkun (Chongqing University),</li><li>Qiu Yihang (Guangdong University of Technology),</li><li>Wang Hao (University of Science and Technology of China),</li><li>Cong Xiang (University of Science and Technology of China),</li><li>Zhu Xuance (University of Science and Technology of China),</li><li>Liang Yuyao (Shenzhen University),</li><li>Liu Jikang (Shenzhen University),</li><li>Yang Zonglin (Shenzhen University),</li><li>Lv Yaxing (Fuzhou University),</li></ul></li><li><strong>Third Phase (2022):</strong><ul><li>Shao Zheqing (University of Science and Technology of China),</li><li>Liu Yuezuo (University of Science and Technology of China),</li><li>Zhang Mingzhe (University of Science and Technology of China),</li><li>Peng Ming (University of Science and Technology of China),</li><li>Ma Zhuang (University of Science and Technology of China),</li><li>Cao Biyuan (Shenzhen University),</li><li>Guan Jinlong (Shenzhen University),</li><li>Chen Kangping (Shenzhen University),</li><li>Gao Xiangyang (Shenzhen University),</li><li>Zhong Jinghui (Shenzhen University),</li><li>Li Jiahui (Fuzhou University),</li><li>Zhang Ping (Fuzhou University),</li><li>Yao Pengju (Fuzhou University),</li></ul></li><li><strong>Fourth Phase (2023):</strong><ul><li>Cai Jianfeng (University of Science and Technology of China),</li><li>Guo Fan (University of Science and Technology of China),</li><li>Wu Zhendong (University of Science and Technology of China),</li><li>Wang Rui (Shenzhen University),</li><li>Ye Xinyu (Beijing Open Source Chip Research Institute),</li><li>Zhao Kexin (Fuzhou University),</li><li>Li Wenchao (Fuzhou University),</li><li>Yang Qiang (Fuzhou University),</li><li>Mei Zhanpeng (Central South University),</li><li>Guo Puxin (Central South University),</li><li>Wang Bingqi (Central South University),</li><li>Kong Menglin (Central South University),</li></ul></li><li><strong>Fifth Phase (2024):</strong><ul><li>You</li></ul></li></ul></details></div><h2 id="four-learning-modules-of-the-project" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#four-learning-modules-of-the-project" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <strong>Four Learning Modules of the Project</strong></h2><p>Welcome to participate in the Water-Drop Plan learning!

Due to the high performance and strong flexibility of C++, it is very suitable for developing complex electronic design automation software.

The C++ language provides a rich standard template library (STL), which can help EDA engineers efficiently implement these algorithms and data structures.</p></div><div class="hint-container info"><p class="hint-container-title">EDA Learning Module (Mandatory)</p><p>The basic knowledge of EDA is the core skill that EDA engineers must master, mainly including the basics of digital circuits, EDA foundation, and advanced EDA learning.
